// Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize themselves automatically 
// when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the 
// container.

// Main commands in vectors

// vector.push_back(new_value) - adds a new element at the back of the vector
// vector.clear() - remove all the elements of the vector container, thus making it size 0.
// vector.erase() - used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
